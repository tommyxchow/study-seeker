Roll a dice and whoever has the highest number wins.

Project Description:
StudySeeker is a web app that allows students to find the best match for a potential
study partner. Instead of only being able to see a name and email like a
typical Piazza post, StudySeeker allows you to view all the relevant info about
a potential study partner at a glance. Students can customize their profile to have
details like their major, classes taken, interests, and more in order to find
the most compatible match for a study buddy. After their study session, students
can also leave a detailed review to let others know how great or not-so-great
they were as a study buddy. On the homepage, students can also see featured users
that have the top rating across the site. 

Typical User:
Our target user for StudySeeker are college students taking any course from any school.
These college students will be looking for another student to study with, usually one
that is taking the same class. The student would create an account, fill out their
profile, and begin browsing for a study buddy. The student can utilize the search
and filter feature to narrow down users with the desired traits. The student can
filter for users taking the same classes, users who have previously taken certain
classes, a minimum rating, and more. When the student has found their desired
study partner, they can then connect with a two-way handshake to automatically
exchange contact information. When they have completed their study session, they
have the option to rate each other and leave a detailed review for others to see.
