<p>My name is Jeff. I am a third year student studying Computer Science <br>
    and engineering at the University of Buffalo. I do not have much experience <br>
    with front-end web development, but I am very excited to learn more! In my free <br>
    time I enjoy running and trying new foods. My favorite pokemon is squirtle.
