      <p>
        I am a senior studying Computer Science at the SUNY University at Buffalo. 
        This is my fifth year and final semester here and I am looking forward to what the 
        future brings. I was originally studying to work in the healthcare field and my sophomore 
        year, I majored in Nursing. The following year I majored in Occupational Therapy and 
        ultimately decided to switch to Computer Science. 

        I was raised in Brooklyn, NY and went to Brooklyn Technical High School. After I am done 
        with my degree, I am planning to become a stay at home dog/baby sitter for my sister. 
        Hopefully in due time I will also land a job as a software engineer at a tech company.
