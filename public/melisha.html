        I'm currently a junior student pursuing Bachelors in computer science at 
        University at Buffalo. I went for this career because I enjoy coding. One 
        of the reason I got into computer science is because I thought that 
        programming games as well as designing websites are very fun and interesting. 
        I hope to learn a lot more in the future. I also enjoy playing video games 
        with friends, drawing digital arts, and singing. I love being creative and 
        designing my own game characters, and websites. I usually play games during 
        free times and one of my favorite game is "Valorant".
