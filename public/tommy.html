      <p>
        I'm currently a senior student at University at Buffalo pursuing
        Bachelors of Science in computer science. I was initially a finance
        major at CUNY Baruch College back in the Fall of 2018, but after one
        semester I ultimately decided that the finance and business world just
        wasn't for me. I was born and raised in Queens, NY, where I discovered
        some of my favorite foods like sushi, fried chicken, and Korean
        barbecue. When I'm not busy studying, I enjoy working on my programming
        side projects, playing video games online with friends, and watching
        live streams on Twitch.tv. My interest in regards to computer science is
        primarily in software engineering field, specifically full stack web and
        mobile development. I enjoy working with declarative frameworks and
        libraries like Flutter, SwiftUI, and React. I recently have been working
        on <a href="https://github.com/tommyxchow/frosty">Frosty</a>, a mobile
        cross-platform Twitch.tv client. Thank you for reading!
