# [Study Seeker](https://webdev.cse.buffalo.edu/hci/teams/commitment)

A responsive web app dedicated to helping students find the best match for a potential study partner.

## Pitch

Study Seeker is a web app that allows students to find the best match for a potential study partner. Instead of only being able to see a name and email like a typical Piazza post, Study Seeker allows you to view all the relevant info about a potential study partner at a glance. Students can customize their profile to have details like their major, classes taken, interests, and more in order to find the most compatible match for a study buddy. After their study session, students can also leave a detailed review to let others know how great or not-so-great they were as a study buddy. On the homepage, students can also see featured users that have the top rating across the site.

## Typical user

Our target user for StudySeeker are college students taking any course from any school. These college students will be looking for another student to study with, usually one that is taking the same class. The student would create an account, fill out their profile, and begin browsing for a study buddy. The student can utilize the search and filter feature to narrow down users with the desired traits. The student can filter for users taking the same classes, users who have previously taken certain classes, a minimum rating, and more. When the student has found their desired study partner, they can then connect with a two-way handshake to automatically exchange contact information. When they have completed their study session, they have the option to rate each other and leave a detailed review for others to see.

## Background

Study Seeker was a semester-long group project completed as part of [CSE 370](https://catalog.buffalo.edu/courses/index.php?abbr=CSE&num=370) at the [University at Buffalo (UB)](https://www.buffalo.edu/). During CSE 370 we covered an applied a variety of topics regarding frontend development including responsive design, typography, style guides, usability testing, A/B testing, globalization and localization, design patterns, and much more.

One of the main requirements for the project was to only use pure React and pure CSS for the frontend. Additionally, the backend and continuous deployment was already provided for us. As a result, the tech stack is React, CSS Modules, and Swagger API for the backend.

We also completed the project using common Agile and Scrum practices including writing and verifying user acceptance tests and tasks, organizing them on Kanban boards, and bi-weekly standup meetings.

Despite having one team member drop in the middle of the semester, we were able to successfully complete the project and achieve the good ol' A. Not all planned features were implemented and we definitely could've improved in many areas of React and styling, but given the circumstances and timeframe I'm proud of what we achieved.
